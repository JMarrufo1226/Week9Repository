<body>
    <p>This is a website I made using HTML, CSS,and Bootstrap for week 9.</p>
    <p>It has a table, form, bootstrap navbar, and the elemnts stack vertically on smaller screens. It was kinda tricky to learn but I think I mostly understand how to use it.</p>
    <p>I decided to base this project on my two cats :)</p>
